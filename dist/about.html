                <p>I am a Computer Science student at City University London, avid Hackathon goer and passionate self
                    learner. Outside of university I spend my time working on side coding projects, working out,
                    volunteering and looking for the best coffe shops.

                <h3>USource Technology</h3>
                <h6>Front-end intern</h6>
                <p>My role required me to pick up various technologies quickly and improve problem solving techniques.
                    One of the
                    things I improved the most on is creating responsive websites that look the same across all
                    browsers. I also contributed to the team by improving performance through removing unnecesary
                    dependencies using NPM scripts instead of Gulp JS.

                <h3>Fortech</h3>
                <h6>Android Intern</h6>
                <p>This position has challenged my technical skills, namely JAVA for Android and knowledge of working
                    with API's
                    but also soft skills. I built an app for Tourists helping them find Landmarks and suggestions in my
                    home town
                    with the help of google maps API. At the end of the summer I had to give a presentation on it and
                    a demo.
                    in front of the Android team.

                <h6>Quality Assurance</h6>
                <p>This position was my first introduction in the IT world. I was always busy with breaking games
                    and thinking outside the box to find bugs. This involved a lot of going back and forth with
                    the Developer in order to fix these issues.
